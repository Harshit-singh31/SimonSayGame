Simon Game Overview:
The Simon Game is a classic memory-based electronic game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds in the correct order. Each round adds a new color to the sequence, increasing the difficulty as the game progresses.

Features:
1.Interactive User Interface: Designed a user-friendly interface with four color pads that light up and produce sounds when clicked.
2.Game Logic: Implemented a sequence generation mechanism that randomly lights up the pads, requiring the user to repeat the sequence.
3.Difficulty Progression: Each round adds one more color to the sequence, making the game progressively harder.
4.Responsive Design: Adapted the game to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
5.Sound Integration: Incorporated unique tones for each color to enhance the user’s memory of the sequence.
6.Restart and High Score Features: Added functionality to track the player’s high score and reset the game after failure.

Technologies Used:
1.HTML/CSS: For the layout and design of the game interface.
2.JavaScript: For game logic, sequence handling, and user interaction.
3.jQuery: Used for DOM manipulation and event handling (optional based on implementation preference).
4.Audio API: For managing the sound effects associated with each color.
